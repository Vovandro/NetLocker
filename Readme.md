# Service for Managing Access to Shared Resources

## Overview

The service provides a solution for managing shared resources on a network using locking mechanisms.
This ensures that multiple clients or processes accessing the same resource do so in a synchronized
manner, preventing race conditions and other issues related to parallelism.

## Features

- **Distributed Locking Functionality**: An efficient network locking mechanism for secure access
  to shared resources.
- **Concurrency Safety**: Prevents data corruption by ensuring that resources are used by only one
  client at a time.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple clients in a distributed environment.
- **Scalability**: Successfully handles an increase in requests with minimal performance degradation.

## How It Works

1. **Resource Identification**: Each resource being accessed has a unique identifier (e.g., a key or name).
2. **Lock Acquisition**: A client acquires a lock for a resource before accessing it. If another client
   currently holds the lock, subsequent requests are queued.
3. **Lock Release**: After completing its work, the client releases the lock, making the resource
   available to others.
4. **Timeout Handling**: Scenarios where the lock cannot be released due to unexpected failures
   are managed using timeouts or lease expiration.
5. **Double-Checking**: When using multiple application instances simultaneously, double-checking is
   implemented to ensure reliable lock acquisition.
